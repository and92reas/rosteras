# rosteras
Greek football website using mostly ASP.NET, C# and SQL

The database of the site is not included. Apart from the files having to do with the site's operation there are some files relating to the platform constructed for the updates of the database (player transfers, game updates). Due to the fact that this is an old side project, the databases are not optimally designed (not in 4NF, tables contain nulls). Moreover the design of the site is not in very high level.

The user of the site is able to view the rankings of the teams, their squad and view some players' statistics. Moreover they can compare players, compare teams, search a player etc. 

Some snapshots of the site might be added in the future.
